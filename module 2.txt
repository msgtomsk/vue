Vue

	-> Vue js does not render HTML elements, it renders only the text.
	-> This is a default behaviour, It is not affected by cross scripting

vue({});

	properties
		-> el -> connect to DOM
		-> data -> store data to use
		-> methods
		-> computed -> dependent properties
		-> watch -> execute code upon data changes

Directives
	-> Is basically an instruction given in a code.
	-> pass arguments to directives using colon.

	1. v-on (listen to something  eg. v-on:click = "fun")
	2. v-bind  (To tell not act as default html attribute.  eg. v-bind:href = "link") 
	3. v-once ---> will execute only once. It will not update later.
	4. v-html ---> output HTML code. (use carefully)
	5. v-model ---> Two way data binding


short hand for directives

	v-on -> @
	v-bind:href -> :href
