Limitations of templates




Vue js instance lifecycle

	new Vue() --> beforeCreate() -> initialize data and events -> instance created  --> created() -> compile template

	--> beforeMount() -> replace element with compiled template -> mounted to the DOM


	if data changes

	data changed --> beforeUpdate() -> Rerender DOM --> updated() --> mounted to the DOM

	beforeDestroy() -> destroyed --> destroyed()



single file template.
